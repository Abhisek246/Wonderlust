**Wanderlust: Ultimate Travel Destination Finder**

Developed a comprehensive travel listing platform using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, with a focus on creating a robust and scalable application. Key features and technologies include:

- **MVC Architecture**: Utilized the MVC framework to structure the application, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and maintainable codebase.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented error handling through middleware, alongside client-side and server-side validation, to enhance the robustness and reliability of the application.
- **User Authentication and Authorization**: Integrated Passport middleware for secure user authentication and authorization, allowing only listing owners and reviewers to modify or delete their posts, thereby enforcing role-based access control.
- **Geo-Coding Integration**: Incorporated Mapbox for geo-coding, enabling users to search and display travel destinations on interactive maps.
- **Image Management**: Leveraged Cloudinary for efficient image upload, storage, and management, optimizing the handling of travel images.
- **Deployment and Hosting**: Deployed the application on Render, ensuring reliable and scalable hosting with adherence to industry best practices for coding and architecture.

**Technologies Used**: MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Passport, Cloudinary, Mapbox.

This project highlights proficiency in building scalable web applications, implementing secure authentication mechanisms, and integrating various services to enhance user experience.
